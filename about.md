Hi, Im Micah (pronounced Mee-kah) 👋🏾
Im a Software Developer based in London. I work primarily with Python and focus on the data space - so Data Engineering, Data Science & Machine Learning

Outside of work, I've got into fitness the past few years. I do some amateur boxing, mostly for fitness and run a bit to help with my conditioning for boxing.
Im a big (NY Knicks) basketball fan, although i dont play, just watch.

I also love to read, drink coffee & hate cooking
