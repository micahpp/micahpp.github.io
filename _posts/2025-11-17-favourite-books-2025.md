### Blood and Treasure: The Economics of Conflict from the Vikings to Ukraine
by Duncan Weldon

A blend of two topics I’m interested in: history and economics. History is fun; economics can be boring, but this book manages to blend the two into a wholly engaging read. Some of my favourite chapters were on:
- How gold made Spain poor
- How the US Civil War made the dollar
- How warfare made the reniassance

### Fatherhood: A History of Love and Power
by Augustine Sedgewick

My favourite non-fiction read this year. A historical look at the nature of fatherhood and how it’s changed over time. From Plato and Aristotle in antiquity to more recent figures like Sigmund Freud and Bob Dylan, one thing remains true: people believed some crazy stuff in the past.



### Strangers and Intimates: The Rise and Fall of Private Life
by Tiffany Jenkins

Similar to Fatherhood, this looks at the idea of privacy in society and how it’s changed through time. It’s interesting to see how, in one time period (e.g. during the Roman Empire), the public sphere was held in higher regard. You fast-forward to a different epoch and the private realm is more revered.


### The Grace of Kings (The Dandelion Dynasty #1)
by Ken Liu

I read the first two books in the series this year and look forward to continuing it next year. I loved both, but enjoyed the first a bit more.

It was a bit intimidating at close to 1000 pages (702 exactly), but the story was really engaging. The first time I sat down to sample a bit of it, I ended up reading for an hour or two. I was so enthralled with the story that I started listening to the audiobook when I couldn’t have the book to hand.

### Exodus: The Archimedes Engine
by Peter F. Hamilton

Sci-fi is one of my favourite genres, but I didn’t read much this year. I sampled a few books but couldn’t get into them for various reasons. Some were too literary for my taste. One in particular, Pandora’s Star (also by Peter F. Hamilton), was really interesting, but I found the plot a bit too slow and hard to follow at times due to the sprawling cast and multiple POVs.

Exodus seems like a refined version of what I wanted out of Pandora’s Star. It’s a space opera, it’s quite descriptive when it comes to technology, and the story moves fast. It also reminds me of The Final Architect series by Tchaikovsky, which I read a few years ago with high hopes but couldn’t get into.
